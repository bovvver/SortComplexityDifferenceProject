## Usage

This program implements five sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, Shell Sort, and Bogo Sort. The program displays tables showing the number of operations required to sort an array of a given length and presents a comparison of the complexities on a graph.
Key Features:

- **Bubble Sort:** A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order,
- **Quick Sort:** An efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a ‘pivot’ element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot,
- **Selection Sort:** An in-place comparison-based algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted,
- **Shell Sort:** An optimization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart,
- **Bogo Sort:** A highly inefficient algorithm based on generating random permutations of the array and checking if the array is sorted.

## Important Notes:

In the default mode, Bogo Sort will always display zero operations because it is disabled by default due to its complexity of *O(n!)*.

To enable Bogo Sort, you need to check the corresponding **checkbox**. However, it is not recommended to input values higher than 10 due to its extremely high complexity.

## Thank you!

If you have made it this far, thank you for your interest!

That's all from me. See you again soon! :wave:
